During my study i had also real quantitative research projects and I did my internship in an innovation research institute. After that i was for a short time a research employee. In this time i was able to boost my skills in SPSS, Excel and data science/analysis in general. Then i´ve started to learn R. Currently i´m working in data management but would like to move more towards data analysis/sciences. But for this i must improve my programming skills and i need more practial experience.',\n",

I enrolled in Master of Computer Science because of high demand in tech but in my university at master's level they didn't really help with any technical stuff and coding as they assumed everything we know from bachelors. So now I dropped out as I felt the time was being wasted by learning quantum computing to cloud to what not. Since I invested so much time in computer science, I want to specialize in data analytics, so I enrolled in Google certificate. I have taken 6 months off. I will be at home just studying and improving my skills. So, what do you recommend how i can make the most of these 6 months. I plan to finish Google certification in the next 2 months, then what do you suggest me and to enter data analytics job at 42, what should I prepare. Please help me sketch a roadmap. Pretty please.
